# This file will track code changes for an autonomous AI learning system.
# The overall goals are to continuously learn from implemented projects, generate new ideas, and automate the process.

Project: Autonomous AI Learning System
Goals:
- Continuously learn from implemented projects 
- Generate innovative new project ideas
- Automate the process of creating, implementing, testing, and learning from projects
- Reflect on learning cycles to generate meta-learnings

Key Components:
1. Knowledge Base - stores facts and knowledge
2. Continuous Learner - extracts learnings from completed projects  
3. Project Creator - generates new project ideas and creates project proposals
4. Workflow Executor - sets up development environment, implements initial prototype, runs tests
5. Code Analyzer - analyzes code for insights 
6. Test Runner - runs automated tests on the implemented code
7. Ollama Interface - queries language model for prompts and reflections

The main AutonomousAssistant class orchestrates the overall learning cycle:
1. Generate project ideas using Project Creator and Ollama
2. Create a new project from an idea using Project Creator 
3. Implement the project using Workflow Executor
4. Analyze code and run tests using Code Analyzer and Test Runner
5. Learn from the completed project using Continuous Learner
6. Reflect on the learning cycle to generate meta-learnings

This looks like a solid foundation for an autonomous AI learning system that can continuously improve its knowledge and capabilities through executing projects.
