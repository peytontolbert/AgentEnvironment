        "Step 1: Lay Out Requirements - Begin by gathering and detailing all project requirements. Ensure clarity and completeness.",
        "Step 2: Create Design and Systems Documentation - Develop detailed design documents, including system architecture and integration points.",
        "Step 3: Develop Folder Structure - Plan and create a logical folder structure to organize code and resources effectively.",
        "Step 4: Create a Mermaid Diagram - Visualize the system architecture and data flow using a Mermaid diagram for better understanding.",
        "Step 5: Create Initial Documentation Files - Set up initial documentation files to track project progress, design decisions, and implementation details.",
        "Step 6: Create File Structure - Set up the initial file structure based on the folder plan.",
        "Step 7: Code Sequentially - Develop code in a logical sequence, ensuring each function is implemented and tested before moving on.",
        "Step 8: Validate Test Units - Create and run unit tests for each function to ensure correctness and reliability.",
        "Step 9: Document Thoroughly - Document each function with detailed comments and update documentation to reflect code changes.",
        "Step 10: Continuous Integration - Regularly integrate and test code to ensure all parts work together seamlessly.",
        "Step 11: Final Testing - Conduct comprehensive testing of the entire codebase to ensure all functionalities are working as expected.",
        "Step 12: Version Control - Use version control systems like Git to track changes and collaborate effectively.",
        "Step 13: Code Review - Conduct peer code reviews to ensure code quality and catch potential issues early.",
        "Step 14: Deployment Strategy - Plan and execute a deployment strategy, including staging environments and rollback plans.",
        "Step 15: Feedback Loop - Implement a feedback loop to gather user feedback and iterate on the software based on real-world usage.",
        "Step 16: Use a Graph Database - Implement a graph database to maintain a comprehensive history of changes and facilitate robust error handling and recovery strategies.",
        "By following these steps, AI can efficiently manage and execute software development projects, ensuring high-quality outcomes."
